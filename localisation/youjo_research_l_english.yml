 tech_mage_speed1_desc:0 "Traditionally, mages were trained to fight alongside infantry, limiting their speed. However, with the ongoing motorization efforts, they should be trained to fight alongside these faster units instead."
 tech_mage_speed2_desc:0 "While mages themselves can move at high speed, they still need to wait for the supply line to catch up during advances. By prioritizing supply for advancing mages, they would spend less time waiting and move even faster."
 tech_mage_speed3_desc:0 "Mages are faster than any ground-based logistics, hindering their advance. By using transport planes, air drops, or even mage cadets to deliver supplies, the speed of mage units can be maximized."
 tech_mage_entrenchment1_desc:0 "Although not the most efficient use of mages, sometimes they have to hold positions on the ground. Thanks to their magic, they can dig better entrenchments faster than regular troops."
 tech_mage_hardness1_desc:0 "Without magic, mages as as vulnerable as anyone else. By improving their readiness at all times, mages will be less likely to be hit by what they can block with magic."
 tech_mage_hardness2_desc:0 "Mages can protect more than just themselves. By training mages to provide cover to others, we can greatly reduce the threat of enemy small arms fire."
 tech_mage_anti_air1_desc:0 "Recent advancements in multi-core operation orbs allow mages to dedicate one core to life support, allowing them to engage aircrafts flying above the traditional combat ceiling of mages."
 tech_marine_mage1_desc:0 "Mages can provide marine landing parties additional firepower and cover without taking up as much space as amphibious tanks."
 tech_marine_mage2_desc:0 "Integrated mage contingents on naval vessels greatly enhances the ships' recon abilities and air defense."
 tech_para_mage1_desc:0 "While mages are airborne by default, they can't be expected to hold ground on their own. By combining them with paratroopers, they would become formidable airborne forces."
 tech_para_mage2_desc:0 "The versatility of mages allows them to land where paratroopers and gliders can't."
